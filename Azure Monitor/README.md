This is an experimentation area for accessing Applicaton Insights via the web API.

# Setup
These steps will create an API key in your applicaton instance and generate a config file with the needed key/value pairs

1. Edit `instance_config.sh` to put in the values from your Application Insights instance
    1. This will attempt to install the azure cli
1. Run `generate_config.sh` to generate an `api_config.ini` file
    1. This creates an api key with the key name specified in `instance_config.sh`.
    1. This can only be run once because the key by that name will already exist for the 2nd run

# Demo
This will pull back some custom metrics using the configs created in above. There are a couple queries in the shell script.

1. Run `query_custom_metrics` to retrieve the last 10 customMetrics
    1. This depends on values you manually inserted in `instance_config.sh` and values generated by script into `app_config.ini`
